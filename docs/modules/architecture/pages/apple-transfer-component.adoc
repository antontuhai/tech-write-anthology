== Introduction

The component architecture of the AppleTransfer system details the internal structure and interactions of components within the RESTful API, along with how the external SDK interfaces with these components. This document provides insights into the modular design that supports the apple transfer functionalities.

== Component overview

The AppleTransfer system's RESTful API is composed of several key components, each responsible for a specific part of the apple transfer process. Together with the AppleTransfer SDK, these components form the backbone of the system's operations.

- *AppleTransfer SDK*: A Python library that offers developers an easy way to incorporate apple transfer functionalities into their applications, interacting directly with the RESTful API's components.

=== RESTful API components

The RESTful API, serving as the core of the AppleTransfer system, includes the following components:

- *Send component*: Manages the initiation of apple transfers, handling requests to send apples to specified recipients.

- *Status component*: Provides functionalities for checking the status of apple transfers, allowing users to track the progress of their transactions.

- *Cancel component*: Enables users to cancel ongoing apple transfers, ensuring flexibility in managing apple transactions.

- *Update component*: Facilitates updates to existing apple transfers, such as modifying the quantity or variety of apples being sent.

- *Database interface*: Acts as a mediator between the API components and the system's database, handling all data storage and retrieval operations.

- *Authentication interface*: Oversees the authentication and authorization processes, securing access to the system's functionalities.

== Interactions between components

The AppleTransfer SDK communicates directly with the RESTful API components, utilizing their functionalities to perform operations related to apple transfers. Each component, in turn, interacts with the Database Interface for data persistence and the Authentication Interface to ensure secure access to the system's features.

== Conclusion

The component architecture of the AppleTransfer system illustrates a well-organized, modular approach to building a scalable and secure application. By clearly delineating responsibilities among the components, the system achieves high cohesion and low coupling, facilitating ease of maintenance and future enhancements. This overview provides a comprehensive understanding of how the AppleTransfer system's components work together to deliver a robust solution for managing apple transfers.

== Introduction

This document details the class architecture of the AppleTransfer SDK, designed to facilitate seamless integration of apple transfer functionalities into third-party applications. The architecture provides developers with a simplified, object-oriented interface, enabling efficient interactions with the AppleTransfer system.

== Class overview

The AppleTransfer SDK is structured around two primary classes: `AppleTransferClient` and `AppleTransaction`. These classes provide a comprehensive API for initiating, managing, and tracking apple transfers.

=== AppleTransferClient class

The `AppleTransferClient` class is the gateway for SDK users to interact with the AppleTransfer API, featuring methods supporting asynchronous operations for improved application responsiveness.

.Attributes
* `apiKey` (String): Used for authentication with the AppleTransfer system.
* `baseUrl` (String): The base URL of the AppleTransfer API.

.Methods
* `async send_apples(recipientSystem, quantity, variety)`: Initiates an apple transfer to a specified recipient system.
* `async check_status(transactionId)`: Retrieves the status of an apple transfer.
* `async cancel_transfer(transactionId)`: Cancels an ongoing apple transfer.
* `async update_transfer(transactionId, quantity, variety)`: Updates the details of an existing apple transfer.

=== AppleTransaction class

The `AppleTransaction` class represents an apple transfer transaction, providing interaction methods for the transaction's lifecycle, including status checks, cancellation, and updates.

.Attributes
* `transactionId` (String): The unique identifier of the apple transfer transaction.

.Methods
* `async status()`: Retrieves the current status of the apple transfer.
* `async cancel()`: Cancels the apple transfer.
* `async update(quantity, variety)`: Updates the quantity or variety of apples being transferred.

=== Supporting classes and patterns

Additional classes and patterns further support the SDK architecture to enhance its functionality and usability:

* `AppleVariety`: A class that could represent different varieties of apples, adding depth to the domain model.
* `TransferHistory`: A class for tracking the history of transactions, useful for auditing and troubleshooting.

Interfaces and abstract classes are introduced to standardize operations across different transaction types, ensuring scalability and extensibility.

== Design patterns and practices

The SDK utilizes design patterns such as Dependency Injection for flexible configuration and the Factory Pattern for creating instances of `AppleTransaction`. These patterns contribute to a modular, maintainable architecture.

== Error handling and validation

Error handling and input validation are integral to the SDK, ensuring developers can manage errors effectively and validate inputs before processing operations.

== Conclusion

The AppleTransfer SDK class architecture offers developers a structured, intuitive interface for integrating apple transfer functionalities. By leveraging asynchronous operations, error handling, and design patterns, the SDK supports the development of robust, user-friendly applications.

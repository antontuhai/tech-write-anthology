Welcome to the *AppleTransfer API Python SDK* documentation! This SDK is a comprehensive toolkit for integrating AppleTransfer's apple transfer functionalities into Python-based applications. Leverage this SDK to seamlessly send apples, manage apple transfers, check statuses, cancel transactions, and update transaction details.

== Installation

Ensure the `requests` library is installed in your Python environment. Install it via pip if necessary:

[source,bash]
----
pip install requests
----

== Getting started

The SDK introduces two pivotal classes: `AppleTransferClient`, the gateway to the AppleTransfer API, and `AppleTransaction`, which facilitates detailed transaction management.

[initialize-client]
=== Initializing the client

Instantiate `AppleTransferClient` with your API key:

[source,python]
----
from apple_transfer_sdk import AppleTransferClient

client = AppleTransferClient(api_key="your_api_key_here")
----

== SDK overview

=== SDK code sample

include::partial$sdk-code-sample.adoc[]

=== AppleTransferClient

This class is your primary interface to the AppleTransfer API, offering methods to initiate and track apple transfers.

.Methods
* `send_apples(recipient_system, quantity, variety)`: Initiates an apple transfer, returning an `AppleTransaction` object for further management.
* `check_status(transaction_id)`: Retrieves the current status of an apple transfer.

=== AppleTransaction

This class represents an individual apple transfer, providing capabilities to query its status, cancel it, or update its details.

.Methods
* `status()`: Returns the transaction's current status.
* `cancel()`: Cancels the ongoing transaction.
* `update(quantity=None, variety=None)`: Modifies the transaction's details.

== Usage examples

=== Sending apples

To send apples, call `send_apples`, which yields an `AppleTransaction` for subsequent interactions:

[source,python]
----
transaction = client.send_apples("recipient123", 10, "Gala")
print(transaction.status())
----

=== Checking transaction status

Query a transaction's status through the `AppleTransaction` instance:

[source,python]
----
print(transaction.status())
----

=== Cancelling a transaction

Cancel a transaction using its `AppleTransaction` instance:

[source,python]
----
response = transaction.cancel()
print(response)
----

=== Updating a transaction

Modify a transaction's details:

[source,python]
----
response = transaction.update(quantity=15, variety="Honeycrisp")
print(response)
----

== Best practices

To optimize your use of the SDK, consider the following:

* Implement exception handling, particularly for operations that depend on network connectivity.
* Be mindful of the API's rate limits to design efficient retry mechanisms.
* Secure your API key diligently; avoid embedding it directly in your source code.

== Conclusion

The AppleTransfer API Python SDK is engineered to empower developers with robust tools for building sophisticated apple transfer solutions. We eagerly anticipate the innovative applications you will create. Happy coding!

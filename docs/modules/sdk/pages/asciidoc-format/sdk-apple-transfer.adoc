The *_AppleTransfer API Python SDK_* provides a straightforward interface to interact with the AppleTransfer API. This SDK simplifies sending apples between systems and checking the status of these transactions.

== Installation

To utilize the SDK, you must first install the necessary 'requests' library.

[source,bash]
----
pip install requests
----

== SDK overview

The SDK provides an `AppleTransferClient` class with methods to access API endpoints.

.SDK code sample
[source,python]
----
import requests

class AppleTransferClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        """Initializes the AppleTransferClient.

        Args:
            api_key (str): Your API key for accessing the AppleTransfer API.
        """
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "https://api.appletransfer.com/v1"

    def send_apples(self, recipient_system, quantity, variety):
        """Send apples to a specified system.

        Args:
            recipient_system (str): Unique identifier of the recipient system.
            quantity (int): Number of apples to send.
            variety (str): Variety of apple, e.g., 'Gala', 'Fuji'.

        Returns:
            dict: Response from the API with transaction details.
        """
        # ... Method implementation ...

    def check_status(self, transaction_id):
        """Check the status of a specific apple transfer.

        Args:
            transaction_id (str): Unique identifier for the apple transfer transaction.

        Returns:
            dict: Response from the API with the current status of the transaction.
        """
        # ... Method implementation ...
----

== Usage

=== Sending apples

To send apples, use the `send_apples` method of the `AppleTransferClient`.

[source,python]
----
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
client = AppleTransferClient(api_key)

# Send 10 Gala apples to the recipient system 'recipient123'
send_response = client.send_apples("recipient123", 10, "Gala")
print("Send Response:", send_response)
----

==== Parameters

* `recipient_system` (str): The unique identifier of the recipient system.
* `quantity` (int): The number of apples to send.
* `variety` (str): The variety of apple.

==== Return value

A dictionary with transaction details including transaction ID and status.

=== Checking status

To check the status of sent transaction, use the `check_status` method.

[source,python]
----
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
client = AppleTransferClient(api_key)

# Assuming you have a transaction ID 'txn_12345'
status_response = client.check_status("txn_12345")
print("Status Response:", status_response)
----

==== Parameters

* `transaction_id` (str): The unique identifier of the apple transfer transaction.

==== Return value

A dictionary containing the status of the transaction, including its current state and a timestamp.

== Note

This SDK is a basic example designed for clarity and ease of use. In a real-world scenario, consider adding more robust error handling, logging, and other features like rate limiting and retry mechanisms.

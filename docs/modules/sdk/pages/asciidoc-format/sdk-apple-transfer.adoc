Welcome to the *AppleTransfer API Python SDK* documentation! This SDK provides a powerful yet simple interface for integrating apple transfer functionalities into your Python applications, enabling you to easily send apples between systems, check their transfer statuses, cancel transactions, and update transaction details.

== Installation

First, ensure you have the `requests` library installed in your Python environment. If not, you can easily install it using pip:

[source,bash]
----
pip install requests
----

== Getting started

The SDK offers two primary classes: `AppleTransferClient` for interacting with the AppleTransfer API and `AppleTransaction` for managing individual transactions.

[initialize-client]
=== Initializing the client

Start by creating an instance of the `AppleTransferClient`:

[source,python]
----
from apple_transfer import AppleTransferClient

client = AppleTransferClient(api_key="your_api_key_here")
----

== SDK overview

=== SDK code sample

include::partial$sdk-code-sample.adoc[]

=== AppleTransferClient

The SDK's main interface provides methods to send apples and check transaction statuses.

[apple-transfer-client-methods]
==== Methods

* `send_apples(recipient_system, quantity, variety)`: Sends apples to a specified system and returns an `AppleTransaction` object.
* `check_status(transaction_id)`: Checks the status of a specific apple transfer transaction.
* `_post(endpoint, data)`: Internal method to make POST requests to the API.
* `_get(endpoint)`: Internal method to make GET requests to the API.

=== AppleTransaction

Represents a specific transaction, allowing you to query its status, cancel it, or update its details.

[apple-transaction-methods]
==== Methods

* `status()`: Retrieves the transaction's current status.
* `cancel()`: Cancels the transaction.
* `update(quantity=None, variety=None)`: Updates the transaction details.

== Usage examples

=== Sending apples

To send apples, use the `send_apples` method. This method returns an `AppleTransaction` object, which you can use to interact further with the transaction:

[source,python]
----
transaction = client.send_apples("recipient123", 10, "Gala")
print(transaction.status())
----

=== Checking transaction status

You can check the status of a transaction directly from the `AppleTransaction` object:

[source,python]
----
print(transaction.status())
----

=== Cancelling a transaction

To cancel a transaction:

[source,python]
----
response = transaction.cancel()
print(response)
----

=== Updating a transaction

To update the details of a transaction:

[source,python]
----
response = transaction.update(quantity=15, variety="Honeycrisp")
print(response)
----

== Best practices

While the SDK is designed to be as straightforward as possible, here are a few tips to ensure you get the best out of it:

* Always handle exceptions, especially for network-related errors.
* Check the API's rate limits and implement retry logic as necessary.
* Secure your API key, and do not hard-code it into your applications.

== Conclusion

Thank you for choosing the AppleTransfer API Python SDK. We're excited to see the incredible applications you'll build with it. Happy coding!
